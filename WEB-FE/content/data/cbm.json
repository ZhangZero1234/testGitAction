      "Component Business Modeling (CBM) is a strategic management framework to identify opportunities for improvement or innovation in an organization. It is a technique for modeling and analyzing an enterprise by partitioning it into a manageable number of relatively independent, discrete, modular, and re-usable business components. A business component is a logical view of part of an enterprise that includes the resources, people, technology, and know-how necessary to deliver capabilities to the organization.",
      "CBM can be used in a variety of ways, the most powerful of which is to create a heat map that identifies the components that provide the greatest opportunity for improvement or innovation. CBM also can be used to create industry-specific, predefined assets."
